## Privacy Policy

Last updated: {{DATE}}

StageLog is a client-side web application. We do not operate servers to receive, store, or process your personal data. All data you enter stays on your device in your browser's localStorage unless you explicitly export it.

What we store locally
- Performances and attributes you enter (show title, date, venue, ratings, expenses, notes)
- App preferences (e.g., theme)

What we do NOT do
- No accounts, logins, or cloud-sync by default
- No third-party trackers, analytics, or advertising
- No cookies (we use localStorage only)

Exports and third parties
- You can export/import your data as files at your discretion.
- If you choose Google Drive export/restore, your data is sent to your own Google account via Google APIs under your control. See `GOOGLE-API-DISCLOSURE.md`.

Regional privacy notes
- GDPR/UK GDPR: You control your data locally. We do not process it server-side.
- CCPA/CPRA: We do not sell or share personal information.
- Other regions (LGPD, PIPEDA, etc.): Same modelâ€”no server processing; transparency and user control apply.

Data retention and deletion
- Data persists locally until you delete it in-app or clear your browser storage.
