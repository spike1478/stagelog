## GDPR Compliance Statement

This project (StageLog) is a 100% client-side web application. By default, it does not transmit your data to any server we control. All data you enter is stored locally in your browser (localStorage) on your device.

What data is handled
- Performance logs you enter (e.g., show titles, dates, venues, ratings, expenses, notes)
- Optional personal notes you choose to store

Data collection and transmission
- No account system; no server-side storage
- No telemetry, analytics, or tracking beacons
- No cookies beyond browser storage primitives (localStorage) used for app preferences and your data
- Optional export/import features are user-initiated (e.g., file download/upload). If you activate a Google Drive export/restore, data is sent to your own Google account via Google's APIs under your control.

Roles under GDPR
- Data Controller: You (the user) control what data is created, stored, exported, or deleted on your device.
- Data Processor: Not applicable. The app does not process data on servers we operate.

Lawful basis
- Not applicable for server-side processing, as we do not receive or process your personal data.

International data transfers
- None performed by us. If you export to third-party services (e.g., Google Drive), transfers occur under that provider’s terms and your configuration.

Data retention
- Your data is stored locally until you delete it via the app’s controls or your browser settings. You may clear local storage at any time.

Data subject rights
- Because data is local and under your control, you can exercise access, rectification, erasure, restriction, portability, and objection by viewing, editing, exporting, or deleting the data in-app or clearing your browser storage.

Security
- Local-only by default. If you export data files, keep them secure. No secrets or credentials are stored by the app.

Subprocessors
- None. If you opt into Google Drive export, Google acts as an independent provider you engage directly.

Breach notification
- Not applicable for our servers (none). For local-only storage, you control the device security.
