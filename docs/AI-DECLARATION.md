## Human Developer Role

The human developer (Maya) maintained full control over:
- **Project Vision**: Overall concept, goals, and feature requirements
- **Design Decisions**: UI/UX choices, user experience priorities
- **Code Review**: Final approval of all AI-generated code
- **Testing**: Manual testing and validation of functionality
- **Deployment**: Final decisions on what to include in releases

## AI Contribution Percentage

**Estimated AI Contribution**: ~70% of code implementation and documentation
**Human Contribution**: ~30% of project vision, requirements, testing, and final decisions

## Transparency Commitment

This project is committed to transparency about AI usage. All AI-assisted code is:
- ✅ Reviewed and approved by human developers
- ✅ Tested thoroughly before implementation
- ✅ Documented with clear attribution
- ✅ Maintained with human oversight

## Ethical Considerations

- **No Plagiarism**: All AI-generated code is original and properly attributed
- **Privacy First**: AI assistance maintained the project's privacy-focused approach
- **Accessibility**: AI help enhanced rather than compromised accessibility standards
- **Open Source**: AI assistance supports the open-source nature of the project

## Future AI Usage

This project may continue to use AI assistance for:
- Bug fixes and improvements
- New feature development
- Documentation updates
- Code optimization

All future AI usage will be documented in this file and commit messages.
