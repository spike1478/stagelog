# AI Declaration

## ðŸ¤– Artificial Intelligence Usage

This project was developed with the assistance of artificial intelligence tools. This declaration provides transparency about AI involvement in the development process.

## AI Tools Used

- **Claude (Anthropic)**: Primary AI assistant used for code development, debugging, and feature implementation
- **ChatGPT (OpenAI)**: Secondary AI assistant for code review and optimization suggestions

## AI-Assisted Development Areas

### Code Development
- **JavaScript Implementation**: AI assistance with core application logic, analytics system, and debugging
- **CSS Styling**: AI help with responsive design, accessibility improvements, and theme implementation
- **HTML Structure**: AI assistance with semantic markup and accessibility features

### Feature Implementation
- **Enhanced Analytics System**: AI-assisted development of completely redesigned analytics with Pro Shot separation
- **Legacy Analytics Deprecation**: AI help implementing deprecation warnings and migration guidance
- **Pro Shot Analytics**: AI assistance creating dedicated Pro Shot tracking and analytics
- **Spending Analytics Fixes**: AI help fixing Pro Shot contamination in spending calculations
- **Future Performance Ratings**: AI assistance fixing rating requirements for future performances
- **Navigation System**: AI help fixing navigation errors and function calls
- **Rating Distribution**: AI assistance fixing broken rating distribution displays
- **Accessibility Compliance**: AI help implementing WCAG 2.2 AA standards
- **Data Management**: AI assistance with localStorage operations and data persistence
- **User Interface**: AI help with responsive design and user experience improvements

- **Code Comments**: AI help with JSDoc comments and inline documentation
- **GitHub Setup**: AI assistance with repository structure and GitHub templates

### Quality Assurance
- **Critical Bug Fixes**: AI assistance identifying and resolving major issues (future performance ratings, Pro Shot contamination, navigation errors)
- **Code Cleanup**: AI help removing debug console logs and cleaning up code for production
- **Data Integrity**: AI assistance ensuring accurate analytics calculations and data filtering
- **Code Optimization**: AI help with performance improvements and code refactoring
- **Testing**: AI assistance with testing strategies and validation
- **Deployment Preparation**: AI help preparing code for production deployment

## Human Developer Role

The human developer (Maya) maintained full control over:
- **Project Vision**: Overall concept, goals, and feature requirements
- **Design Decisions**: UI/UX choices, user experience priorities
- **Code Review**: Final approval of all AI-generated code
- **Testing**: Manual testing and validation of functionality
- **Deployment**: Final decisions on what to include in releases

## AI Contribution Percentage

**Estimated AI Contribution**: ~70% of code implementation and documentation
**Human Contribution**: ~30% of project vision, requirements, testing, and final decisions

## Transparency Commitment

This project is committed to transparency about AI usage. All AI-assisted code is:
- âœ… Reviewed and approved by human developers
- âœ… Tested thoroughly before implementation
- âœ… Documented with clear attribution
- âœ… Maintained with human oversight

## Ethical Considerations

- **No Plagiarism**: All AI-generated code is original and properly attributed
- **Privacy First**: AI assistance maintained the project's privacy-focused approach
- **Accessibility**: AI help enhanced rather than compromised accessibility standards
- **Open Source**: AI assistance supports the open-source nature of the project

## Future AI Usage

This project may continue to use AI assistance for:
- Bug fixes and improvements
- New feature development
- Documentation updates
- Code optimization

All future AI usage will be documented in this file and commit messages.
