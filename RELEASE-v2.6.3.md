# 🎭 StageLog v2.7.0 - Enhanced Analytics & Pro Shot Features

**Release Date:** October 1, 2025  
**Version:** 2.7.0  
**Type:** Minor Release (New Features & Enhancements)

---

## 🐛 Critical Bug Fixes

### 1. **Stats System Data Misinterpretation** 
**Issue:** Analytics system was incorrectly treating show records as performance records when the performances array was empty, leading to broken calculations and NaN values in charts.

**Fix:**
- Removed dangerous fallback that read `stagelog_shows` when `stagelog_performances` was empty
- Added comprehensive data validation to ensure only actual performance records are processed
- Added field validation for performance-specific fields (`date_seen`, `show_id`)
- Added NaN protection in calculation methods
- Added object structure validation to prevent malformed data processing

**Impact:** ✅ No more incorrect analytics, NaN values, or broken weighted ratings

### 2. **Future Performance Rating Requirements Bug**
**Issue:** Future performances were incorrectly requiring ratings when they should be optional, and editing future performances was defaulting ratings to '1' instead of leaving them empty.

**Fix:**
- Added `novalidate` attribute to performance form to disable HTML5 validation
- Fixed `handleDateChange()` method to properly remove `required` attributes for future performances
- Updated `editPerformance()` to handle future vs past performance rating population correctly
- Added `resetForm()` call to `handleDateChange()` to ensure proper form state after reset

**Impact:** ✅ Future performances no longer require ratings, editing preserves empty ratings correctly

### 3. **Spending Analytics Pro Shot Contamination**
**Issue:** All spending calculations (averages, totals, price ranges) included Pro Shot performances, dramatically skewing live theatre spending statistics.

**Fix:**
- Updated `stats-system.js` to filter out Pro Shots from all spending calculations
- Updated `database.js` expense statistics to exclude Pro Shots
- Updated `app-fixed.js` expense stats to exclude Pro Shots
- Maintained separate Pro Shot analytics in enhanced analytics page

**Impact:** ✅ Live theatre spending statistics are now accurate and unaffected by Pro Shot data

### 4. **Firebase Sync Memory Leaks**
**Issue:** Event listeners and heartbeat intervals were not being properly cleaned up on disconnect/reconnect, causing memory leaks and performance degradation.

**Fix:**
- Added proper listener tracking with reference and listener function storage
- Added heartbeat interval tracking for cleanup
- Created centralized `cleanupListeners()` method
- Added cleanup on room setup, page unload, and visibility changes
- Added resource optimization with heartbeat pausing when tab is hidden

**Impact:** ✅ No more memory leaks, better performance, battery optimization

### 5. **Wikidata SPARQL Injection Vulnerability**
**Issue:** User input was directly interpolated into SPARQL queries without sanitization, allowing potential injection attacks.

**Fix:**
- Added `sanitizeSparqlInput()` method with comprehensive input sanitization
- Removes dangerous SPARQL characters: quotes, syntax chars, operators, variable prefixes
- Added input validation for query type and length
- Added injection attempt detection with security logging
- Limited query length to prevent resource exhaustion attacks

**Impact:** ✅ No more injection attacks, secure search functionality
