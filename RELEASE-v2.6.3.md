# 🎭 StageLog v2.6.3 - Critical Bug Fixes & Security Improvements

**Release Date:** September 18, 2025  
**Version:** 2.6.3  
**Type:** Patch Release (Bug Fixes & Security)

---

## 🐛 Critical Bug Fixes

### 1. **Stats System Data Misinterpretation** 
**Issue:** Analytics system was incorrectly treating show records as performance records when the performances array was empty, leading to broken calculations and NaN values in charts.

**Fix:**
- Removed dangerous fallback that read `stagelog_shows` when `stagelog_performances` was empty
- Added comprehensive data validation to ensure only actual performance records are processed
- Added field validation for performance-specific fields (`date_seen`, `show_id`)
- Added NaN protection in calculation methods
- Added object structure validation to prevent malformed data processing

**Impact:** ✅ No more incorrect analytics, NaN values, or broken weighted ratings

### 2. **Firebase Sync Memory Leaks**
**Issue:** Event listeners and heartbeat intervals were not being properly cleaned up on disconnect/reconnect, causing memory leaks and performance degradation.

**Fix:**
- Added proper listener tracking with reference and listener function storage
- Added heartbeat interval tracking for cleanup
- Created centralized `cleanupListeners()` method
- Added cleanup on room setup, page unload, and visibility changes
- Added resource optimization with heartbeat pausing when tab is hidden

**Impact:** ✅ No more memory leaks, better performance, battery optimization

### 3. **Wikidata SPARQL Injection Vulnerability**
**Issue:** User input was directly interpolated into SPARQL queries without sanitization, allowing potential injection attacks.

**Fix:**
- Added `sanitizeSparqlInput()` method with comprehensive input sanitization
- Removes dangerous SPARQL characters: quotes, syntax chars, operators, variable prefixes
- Added input validation for query type and length
- Added injection attempt detection with security logging
- Limited query length to prevent resource exhaustion attacks

**Impact:** ✅ No more injection attacks, secure search functionality

---

## 🔒 Security Improvements

- **Input Sanitization:** All user inputs to Wikidata search are now properly sanitized
- **Attack Detection:** System logs potential injection attempts for monitoring
- **Length Limiting:** Query length is limited to prevent resource exhaustion
- **Comprehensive Validation:** Enhanced data validation throughout the application

---

## ⚡ Performance Improvements

- **Memory Management:** Fixed memory leaks in Firebase sync system
- **Resource Optimization:** Heartbeat intervals pause when tab is hidden
- **Error Handling:** Improved error handling and validation
- **Data Processing:** More efficient data validation and processing

---

## 🛡️ Reliability Improvements

- **Data Validation:** Robust validation prevents malformed data from breaking analytics
- **Error Recovery:** Better error handling and graceful fallbacks
- **Resource Cleanup:** Proper cleanup of listeners and intervals
- **Input Validation:** Enhanced validation for all user inputs
