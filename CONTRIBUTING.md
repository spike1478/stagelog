## Development Guidelines

### Architecture Principles

1. **No Frameworks**: Keep it vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
2. **Accessibility First**: All features must be accessible
3. **Privacy Focused**: No external tracking or data collection
4. **Progressive Enhancement**: Core functionality works without JavaScript
5. **Mobile First**: Responsive design from the start

### File Organization

- `index.html` - Main application file
- `styles.css` - All styling and theming
- `app-fixed.js` - Core application logic
- `stats-system.js` - Analytics and statistics
- `analytics-functions.js` - Analytics page functions
- `debug-system.js` - Debugging tools
- `init-code.js` - Initialization code

### Data Handling

- All data stored in localStorage
- No server-side dependencies
- Export/import functionality for data portability
- Graceful handling of missing or corrupted data

### Accessibility Requirements

All contributions must maintain WCAG 2.2 AA compliance:
- Color contrast ratios of at least 4.5:1
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader compatibility
- Focus management
- Semantic HTML structure
- Proper ARIA labels and roles
