## 🐛 Critical Bug Fixes

### 1. **Future Performance Rating Requirements Bug**
**Issue:** Future performances were incorrectly requiring ratings when they should be optional, and editing future performances was defaulting ratings to '1' instead of leaving them empty.

**Fix:**
- Added `novalidate` attribute to performance form to disable HTML5 validation
- Fixed `handleDateChange()` method to properly remove `required` attributes for future performances
- Updated `editPerformance()` to handle future vs past performance rating population correctly
- Added `resetForm()` call to `handleDateChange()` to ensure proper form state after reset

**Impact:** ✅ Future performances no longer require ratings, editing preserves empty ratings correctly

### 2. **Spending Analytics Pro Shot Contamination**
**Issue:** All spending calculations (averages, totals, price ranges) included Pro Shot performances, dramatically skewing live theatre spending statistics.

**Fix:**
- Updated `stats-system.js` to filter out Pro Shots from all spending calculations
- Updated `database.js` expense statistics to exclude Pro Shots
- Updated `app-fixed.js` expense stats to exclude Pro Shots
- Maintained separate Pro Shot analytics in enhanced analytics page

**Impact:** ✅ Live theatre spending statistics are now accurate and unaffected by Pro Shot data

### 3. **Navigation System Fixes**
**Issue:** Navigation system had function call errors and broken page loading.

**Fix:**
- Fixed `loadMyShows` function call error in navigation system
- Resolved navigation function mismatches between standalone functions and class methods
- Improved page loading reliability and error handling

**Impact:** ✅ Navigation works smoothly without console errors

### 4. **Rating Distribution Display Issues**
**Issue:** Rating distribution was broken on both legacy and enhanced analytics pages.

**Fix:**
- Fixed rating distribution data structure and empty state handling
- Updated CSS classes for consistent styling across both analytics systems
- Added proper filtering for rated vs unrated performances
- Improved percentage calculations and data validation

**Impact:** ✅ Rating distribution displays correctly on all analytics pages

## 🔒 Security Improvements

- **Input Sanitization:** All user inputs to Wikidata search are now properly sanitized
- **Attack Detection:** System logs potential injection attempts for monitoring
